#### Folders

**`layers`**

This folder contains all data files to be used for layers in calculating the index scores. These layers are created in the data preparation step, in the `bhi-prep` repo; registering these files in `layers.csv` links the layer with the particular filename and other meta information.

**`conf`**

Configuration folder containing: 

- `config.R` which specifies weightings of index dimensions and some other configuration details

- `scenario_data_years.csv` specifies alignment between 'data years' when measurements are takes and 'scenario years' for which scores are aggregated

- `rgns_complete.csv` file containing information for the index spatial configuration scheme

- `goals.csv` guides ordering of goal/subgoal/dimension calculations

- Pressure and resilience matrices and tables to specify relative importance of different pressures and resilience components

**`functions`**

A folder containing goal functions in individual scripts, with potentially multiple functions per goal. These scripts are compiled into one `functions.R` script by the `configure_functions` function. This piecewise approach is designed for conducting multiple analyses or comparing functional approaches within a given assessment, e.g. scenario testing or sensitivity analysis.

**`reports`**

Figures and documents subfolders contain content generated for reports, including flowerplots generated by `ohicore`.

**`temp`**

Files generated on the fly by various `ohicore` functions, or in other analyses.
