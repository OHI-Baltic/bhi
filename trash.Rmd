MINIMIZING POLLUTION BY PLASTICS
</h4>

<h5 style="font-size:23px">
This goal assesses a region's ability to manage micro-litter as a proxy for litter in order to prevent it from entering the ocean and causing harm to the coastal and marine environments.
</h5>

<h5>
One of the main ways microplastics enter water systems is through the use of personal care products that contain microplastics. These get flushed down household drains, pass the sewage system before ending up in the Baltic Sea.

WHAT DOES THIS SCORE MEAN?
</h4>

The annual average concentration of particles per mÂ³ in 2m surface sea layers based on years 2016-2017, was used as a proxy for the goal.

A high score indicates that the annual average concentration of microplastics fall below the target, defined similar to the MSFD macro-litter beach monitoring (15% of the present state).

A standardized monitoring approach for macrolitter at beaches is being implemented in most of the Baltic Sea countries. The time series are still short and a joint Baltic database is only under development. In future, macrolitter might be a suitable additional indicator to assess trash.
