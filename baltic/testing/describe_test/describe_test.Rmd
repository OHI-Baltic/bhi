```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)
source(file.path(here::here(), "R", "testing.R")) # testing.R sources common.R which creates dir_baltic
setwd(file.path(dir_baltic, "testing", "describe_test"))
```


### Summary of the Analysis

Synopsis of the _Description of the Analysis_ and _Summary of Results_ sections below.

### Rationale

Reasons we decided it was worthwhile to do this analysis.

### Description of the Analysis: Simulated Data or Alternative Model Specifications

Pretty detailed description of what this test is all about, what kinds of data we're going to test and why. Any variations in parameters, summary of alternate data preparation, links to documentation of alternative data prep, and visualiations.

```{r example of some test we did in data prep}

```

### Run Calculations

```{r configuring test and calculating alternative scores}
test_path <- getwd() # set working directory to testing subdirectory in setup code chunk
prep_path <- sprintf("%s%s", bhi_baltic, "-prep/prep")
test_layers <- file.path(bhi_baltic, "testing", "alt_layers.csv") # testing.R sources common.R which creates dir_baltic

configure_functions(bhi_baltic) # write functions to use into functions.R
configure_layers(bhi_baltic, prep_path, test_path)

## calculate scores...
repo_loc <- paste0(prep_repo_raw, "/master")
copy_lyrs_from_bhiprep(bhi_baltic, repo_loc)
calculate_scores(bhi_baltic, c(2015, 2018), scores_path = getwd())
```
