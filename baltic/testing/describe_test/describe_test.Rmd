```{r set up}
setwd(file.path(here::here(), "baltic/testing/describe_test"))

source(sprintf("%s/R/testing.R", here::here()))
source(sprintf("%s/R/common.R", here::here()))

```


## Description

Pretty detailed description of what this test is all about, what kinds of data we're going to test and why. Any variations in parameters, summary of alternate data preparation, links to documentation of alternative data prep, and visualiations.

```{r example of some test we did in data prep}

```



## Running Calculations

```{r configuring test and calculating alternative scores}

assessment_path <- sprintf("%s/baltic", here::here())
prep_path <- sprintf("%s%s", here::here(), "-prep/prep")

configure_functions(assessment_path) # write functions to use into functions.R
sink() # stop sinking...

test_layers <- sprintf("%s/testing/alt_layers_full_table.csv", assessment_path)
configure_layers(assessment_path, prep_path)

## calculate scores...
repo_loc <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OHI-Science/bhi-prep/master"
copy_layers_for_assessment(assessment_path, repo_loc)
calculate_scores(assessment_path, c(2015, 2018), scores_path = getwd())
```
