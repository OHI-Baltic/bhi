# assessment folder

<br/>

**`conf`**

Configuration folder containing pressure and resilience matrices and category tables which specify relative importance of different pressures and resilience components, `configuration.R` which specifies weightings of index dimensions and some other configuration details, and a web folder.

<br/>

**`layers`**

This folder contains all data files to be used for layers in calculating the index scores. These layers are created in the data preparation step, in the `bhi-prep` repo; registering these files in `layers.csv` links the layer with the particular filename.

A folder for conducting additional analyses within a given assessment year, including scenario testing and sensitivity analysis. See `README.md` within the folder for more information. 

<br/>
