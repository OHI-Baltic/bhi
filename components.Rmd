Scores are calculated for each region individually and then combined (with an offshore area-weighted average) to produce scores for the entire Baltic Sea.  There are 42 BHI regions in the Baltic Sea, created by intersecting exclusive economnic zones (EEZs) with the Baltic Sea subbasins, and splitting the Finnish Archipelago Sea into it's own region according to WFD boundaries.]
