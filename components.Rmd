Goals
</h4>

The BHI measures status and progress towards nine widely held goals that represent key benefits and services which marine systems provide to people now and into the future. By analyzing these goals together we obtain a comprehensive picture of the state of the sea. 

Each goal measures the delivery of benefits with respect to a sustainable target. Scores under 100 indicate failure to reach the 'acceptable' levels decided upon by the relevant governing bodies, and science experts.

Dimensions
</h4>

Multiple data layers are used to calculate each goal's 4 dimensions: status, trend, pressures, and resilience. Some data layers &mdash; particularly pressure and resilience layers &mdash; are used in more than one goal. A goal's score is a combination of its dimensions, and a region's overall BHI score is a combination of all goal scores from the region.


To improve understanding of the likely near-term future condition, resilience and pressure dimensions are included. The likely future condition suggested (not predicted!) by short-term trends will become more or less optimistic depending on the counterbalance of pressure versus resilience.

Pressures & Resilience
</h4>

Pressures are ecological and social activities or characteristics that negatively affect scores for a goal. The Baltic Sea is impacted by multiple pressures including excessive nutrients, elevated levels of hazardous substances, introduction of non-native species and habitat degradation as well as unsustainable fishing pressure.

Resilience comprises measures with potential to increase status by reducing or eliminating pressures. Its three components are: ecological integrity (biodiversity), goal-specific regulations, and social integrity (political stability, anti-corruption).
