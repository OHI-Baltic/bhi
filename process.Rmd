Much of the value of the BHI is in the process, which is collaborative, transparent, and iterative. 
<br>
<br>
Before beginning: 1) read about the OHI framework to confirm it is the right tool and learn from other earlier assessments, 2) build a team of stakeholders and analysts who will co-create the assessment, and 3) identify the specific needs and spatial area of interest.
<br>
<br>
Once the assessment begins, there are three phases: data exploration, modelling, and communication of results. Each involves a dynamic exchange between stakeholders and analysts as the team balances comprehensiveness and feasibility. This exchange is an opportunity identify critical knowledge/data gaps or other limitations.
