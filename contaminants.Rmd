MINIMIZING POLLUTION BY CONTAMINANTS

This goal captures the degree to which waters are polluted by contaminants.

<h5>
The Baltic Sea is the most polluted sea in the world. Contaminants harm human health, livelihoods, and recreation, as well as the health of marine life and habitats.

<h4 style="color:#051729;line-height:50px;font-weight:600;">
WHAT DOES THIS SCORE MEAN?
</h4>

Four indicators are combined in this subgoal: the contamination levels of three pollutant groups (PCBs, PFOS, and Dioxins), and the monitored proportion of persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic Substances of Very High Concern (SVHC).

A high score indicates that all contamination levels of the three pollutant groups fall below their respective thresholds, and all persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic Substances of Very High Concern monitored.

The proportion of persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic Substances of Very High Concern monitored in the Baltic Sea is used as one of the indicators to highlight the general lack of knowledge on occurrence of emerging contaminants in the Baltic Sea. This can be developed further to better combine the two aspects of the contaminant goal: current health of the Baltic Sea, and lack of data.
