WHAT DOES THIS SCORE MEAN?
</h4>

This goal uses data on coastal accommodations (nights stayed in tourist accommodation establishments, in coastal regions) and coastal tourism revenue (gross value added).

A high score indicates that the maximum revenue-to-accommodations ratio has been achieved between 2012 and 2018.

How dimensions of ocean health affect peopleâ€™s perceptions and value for spending time in coastal and marine areas could be explored further, to better model how tourism potential is fulfilled across the Baltic Sea and how it may respond to management actions or changing environmental conditions.
