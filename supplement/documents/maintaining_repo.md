### Keeping Readmes Current & Relevant

**Functions in `management.R`**

The functions written and documented in `R/management.R` were designed to make maintenance easier. 
For example, `bhiRfun_readme` looks at the roxygen documentation in a script and creates a formatted chunk of text about the contents to paste into a readme, so it is possible to look up functions' locations and their use just by refering to the main readme. 

See `R/README.md` for more details.


**Main Readme as GitHub Homepage**

The Readme in the root `bhi` folder essentially acts as a homepage for visitors to the GitHub repo. 
To make this as helpful as possible, the Readme should be kept up to date with the following information:

* up-to-date introduction at top of the document, indicating aims and progress of the current assessment
* relevant links in 'Learn more about the Baltic Health Index' section
* functional urls for links throughout
