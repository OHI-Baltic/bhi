<!-- some text about the goal -->

<div class="content">
<h4 style="color:#051729;line-height:50px;font-weight:600;">
WHAT DOES THIS SCORE MEAN?
</h4>

This goal is composed of a single component: revenue (Gross Value Added) and is used to measure the output or contribution of a particular sector.

A high score indicates that all marine economic sectors achieve the average annual growth rate target of 1.5%.

Extractive economic activities measured in this goal could be included in the index as minor pressures on other goals, in which case the contraction of these sectors would potentially correspond to increases in scores of other goals such as biodiversity or sense of place.
