PRESERVING HABITATS THAT ABSORB CARBON

This goal captures the carbon stored in natural coastal ecosystems that absorb and sequester carbon in large amounts.

<h5>
Vegetated coastal ecosystems play a critical role in capturing carbon that would otherwise remain as atmospheric carbon dioxide and aggravate climate change.

WHAT DOES THIS SCORE MEAN?
</h4>

Highly productive coastal wetland ecosystems play a significant role in mitigating carbon levels in the Baltic Sea, and observations of coastal lagoons and shallow inlets and bays were used as indicators for carbon storage for the Baltic Sea area.

A high score indicates that these carbon-storing coastal wetland ecosystems reach the conservation objectives.

Better data on distribution (depth limits and areal extent) and function (sequestration rates, transport and burial processes) of marine vegetation are required to accurately assess this goal in the future.
