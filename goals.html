<h2>Food Provision: Fisheries</h2>
<p><br></p>
<p><br> Goal Description</p>
<p>The Fisheries sub-goal of Food Provision describes the ability to maximize the sustainable yield of wild-caught seafood for human consumption. <strong>For the BHI cod and herring stocks in the Baltic Sea were included as wild-caught fisheries</strong>.</p>
<p><br> Model &amp; Data</p>
<p>The data used for this goal are cod and herring spawning biomass (SSB) and fishing mortality (F) data. The current status is calculated as a function of the ratio between the single species current biomass at sea (B) and the reference biomass at maximum sustainable yield (BMSY), as well as the ratio between the single species current fishing mortality (F) and the fishing mortality at maximum sustainable yield (FMSY). These ratios (B/Bmsy and F/Fmsy) are converted to scores between 0 and 1 using as one component this <a href="https://github.com/OHI-Science/bhi-prep/blob/master/prep/FIS/Fscoresformula.png">general relationship</a>. This piecewise equation simply converts the F/FMSY value to an F' score that will fall between 0-1 (this function applies a penalty when B/BMSY scores indicate good/underfishing but F/FMSY scores indicate high fisheries related mortality).</p>
<p><a href="http://standardgraphs.ices.dk/stockList.aspx">Cod and herring data can be found here</a>. Search for cod or herring, then specify the ecoregion as Baltic Sea and search for the most current assessment.</p>
<p><br> Reference points</p>
<p>The reference point used for the computation are based on the MSY principle and are described as a functional relationship. MSY means the highest theoretical equilibrium yield that can be continuously taken on average from a stock under existing average environmental conditions without significantly affecting the reproduction process <em>(European Union 2013, World Ocean Review 2013).</em></p>

<h2>Food Provision: Mariculture</h2>
<p><br></p>
<p><br> Goal Description</p>
<p>The Mariculture sub-goal describes a country's ability to maximize the sustainable yield of farmed fish in the ocean for human consumption.</p>
<p><br> Model &amp; Data</p>
<p>Sustainable mariculture represents a good supplementary opportunity that can support food provisioning needs, especially when considering not compromising the water quality in the farmed area and not relying on wild populations to feed or replenish the cultivated species. However, assessing the sustainable production of farmed fish can be difficult, as information is limited (location of the fish farms, species produced, nutrient and antibiotic release from these farms). Overall, in terms of total fish production, mariculture is at the moment not a large industry in the Baltic Sea, and dominated by rainbow trout production, which was included using available national data.</p>
<p><strong>Despite the production of rainbow trouts in some Baltic countries (Denmark, Germany, Sweden and Finland), there is currently very limited data on nutrient discharge, and therefore the Mariculture sub-goal was not assessed and will not contribute to the overall Food Provision goal score.</strong></p>
<p><br> Reference points</p>
<p>The maximum nutrient discharge for both phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) could be used as target for this sub-goal, if information is available. The <a href="http://www.helcom.fi/Recommendations/Rec%2025-4.pdf">HELCOM Recommendation</a>, provides a management target that existing and new marine fish farms should not exceed the annual average of 7g of P (total-P) and 50g of N (total-N) per 1kg fish (living weight) produced.</p>

<h2>Artisanal Fishing Opportunity</h2>
<p><br></p>
<p><br> Goal Description</p>
<p>The Artisanal Fishing Opportunities goal, often also called small-scale fishing, provides a critical source of food, nutrition, poverty alleviation and livelihood opportunities for many people around the world, in particular in developing nations. This goal measures whether people who need to fish on a small, local scale have the opportunity to do so. It has three sub-components: stock, access, and need. A score of 100 means the country or region is meeting the needs of artisanal fishermen or communities by implementing institutional supports, providing access to near-shore water, and maintaining the health of targeted species.</p>
<p><strong>For the BHI, the focus is on the <em>stock</em> sub-component and will use this as a proxy for the entire goal.</strong></p>
<p><br> Model &amp; Data</p>
<p>The Artisanal Fishing Opportunities goal (AO) model assesses the health of fish stocks. Two HELCOM core indicators are included:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>abundance of coastal fish key functional groups (Catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) of cyprinids/mesopredators and CPUE of piscivores);</li>
<li>abundance of key coastal fish species (CPUE of perch, cod or flounder, depending on the area).</li>
</ol>
<p>Environmental status assessments were provided by Jens Olsson (SLU, Sweden), see also HELCOM FISH-PRO II (<a href="http://www.helcom.fi/helcom-at-work/projects/fish-pro/" class="uri">http://www.helcom.fi/helcom-at-work/projects/fish-pro/</a>). CPUE data used in the GES assessment. Data provided by Jens Olsson was also used in trend. Slopes from each analysis available here, but CPUE data held internally in the BHI database and not accessible here.</p>
<p><br> Reference values</p>
<p>Previously, indicator status was scored per monitoring area using the assessment protocol for coastal fish (baseline or trend-based approach) =&gt; yielding whether or not the status per monitoring area is <strong>Good Environmental Status (GES)</strong> or <strong>subGES</strong>. If a monitoring station received a &quot;sub-GES&quot; assessment, it was given a qualifier as &quot;low&quot; or &quot;high&quot;.<br />
Environmental status assessments were provided by Jens Olsson (SLU, Sweden). See <a href="http://www.helcom.fi/helcom-at-work/projects/fish-pro/">HELCOM FISH-PRO II</a> now in progress for the <a href="https://helcom.fi/helcom-at-work/projects/fish-pro-iii/">HELCOM FISH-PRO III</a></p>
<p>Now, for the newer assessment, to match the <a href="http://stateofthebalticsea.helcom.fi/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/HELCOM_The_integrated_assessment_of_biodiversity_supplementary_report_first_version_2017.pdf">BEAT-tool as developed within HOLAS II</a>, indicator status was normalized in categorial classes: - Nearest lower value of 0.125 = 0.125 - Nearest lower value of 0.375 = 0.375 - Nearest lower value of 0.6 = 0.6 - Nearest lower value of 0.875 = 0.875 where <strong>threshold value = 0.6</strong>. Threshold values for the status assessments are identified based on site-specific time-series data for each indicator, as coastal fish generally have local population structures, limited migration, and show local responses to environmental change. <em>See also powerpoint provided by Jens Olsson of BHI shared folder</em></p>

<h2>Natural Products</h2>
<p><br></p>
<p><br> Goal Description</p>
<p>This goal measures how sustainably people harvest non-food products from the sea. From seashells and sponges to aquarium fish, natural products contribute to local economies and international trade. <strong>For the BHI sprat was included as a natural product</strong> because it often used for fish meal production or animal food.</p>
<p><br> Model &amp; Data Overview</p>
<p>The data used for this goal are composed of total sprat spawning biomass (SSB) and fishing mortality (F) data. The current status is calculated exactly as described in the Fisheries goal. The spawning biomass data have been accessed from the <a href="http://www.ices.dk/marine-data/tools/Pages/stock-assessment-graphs.aspx">ICES homepage</a> by searching for ‘sprat’ &gt; specify the ecoregion as Baltic Sea &gt; search for the 2013 assessment.</p>
<p><br> Reference points</p>
<p>The reference point used for the computation are based on the MSY principle and are described as a functional relationship. MSY means the highest theoretical equilibrium yield that can be continuously taken on average from a stock under existing average environmental conditions without significantly affecting the reproduction process <em>(European Union 2013, World Ocean Review 2013).</em></p>

<h2>Carbon Storage</h2>
<p><br></p>
<p><br> Goal Description</p>
<p>The Carbon Storage goal captures the ability of the coastal habitats to remove carbon given their carbon uptake rate and health conditions. A score of 100 means all habitats that contribute to carbon removal are still intact or have been restored and they can function to their full carbon burial potential. Highly productive coastal wetland ecosystems or seagrass store substantially large amount of carbon have the highest sequestration rates of any habitats on earth. They are also threatened by under-regulated coastal development but are amenable to restoration and conservation efforts.</p>
<p>For the BHI, as data was limited we only used seagrass (_Zostera sp.) coverage data to assess vegetation-based carbon storage. There is high uncertainty associated with using only seagrass data. However, we aim to highlight the need to better monitor marine vegetation in order to understand the carbon storage capacity in coastal areas.</p>
<p><br> Model &amp; Data</p>
<p>Seagrass data (Zostera sp.) data were downloaded from the <a href="http://maps.helcom.fi/website/Biodiversity/index.html">HELCOM Map &amp; Data service</a>. Select: Biodiversity &gt;&gt; Red List &gt;&gt; Macrophytes &gt;&gt; Least concern (LC) &gt;&gt; Zostera marina (LC).</p>
<p>The data were classified as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>0 = no observations<br />
</li>
<li>1 = present before year 1995 or in 1995<br />
</li>
<li>2 = present after year 1995<br />
</li>
<li>3 = present before and after year 1995</li>
</ul>
<p><br> Reference points</p>
<p>A Zostera sp classification of 2 (present after year 1995) or 3 (present before and after year 1995) have used as reference points.</p>
<!-- <br> Considerations for BHI 3.0 -->
<!-- As availability of seagrass extent data is limited, higher-resolution and more recent coverage data should be used for analysis. Also, include spatial data from remote sensing for saltmarshes, sheltered shallow bays, lagoons and reed belts, as well as other indicators, such as freshwater macrophyte distribution and monitoring data for the northern Baltic areas. -->

<h2>Tourism &amp; Recreation</h2>
<p><br></p>
<p><br> Goal Description</p>
<p>Tourism in coastal areas is a major component of thriving coastal communities and a measure of how much people value ocean systems, i.e. by traveling to coastal and ocean areas. This goal is not about the revenue or livelihoods that are generated by tourism and recreation (that is captured in the livelihoods and economiess goal) but instead captures the value that people have for experiencing and enjoying coastal areas. A score of 100 means a region utilizes its full recreational potential without harming the ecosystem.</p>
<p>In the BHI, we used revenue data (gross value added of coastal tourism activities) from the EU Study on Blue Growth, as well as Eurostat data (nights spent at tourist accommodation establishments by coastal and non-coastal area) to assess the status of Tourism. Economic activities under the Coastal tourism sector, Accommodation and Transport, were included. No sustainability measure of coastal tourism on the Baltic Sea scale was found, and thus this dimension was not included in the BHI2.0.</p>
<p><br> Model &amp; Data</p>
<p>Data for each country were downloaded from the <a href="https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/maritimeforum/node/3550">EU-Study on Blue Growth</a>, Maritime Policy and the EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region” identified the potential for Blue Growth in each of the EU Member States (MS) of the Baltic Sea Region (BSR) and at sea basin level. The tourism model also incorporates the nights of stay in accommodations in coastal regions, which used Eurostat dataset on <a href="http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=tour_occ_nin2c&amp;lang=en">nights spent at tourist accommodation establishments by coastal and non-coastal area</a>.</p>
<p>The status is the ratio of coastal tourism revenue relative to the coastal accommodations per area, scaled by the reference point.</p>
<p><br> Reference points</p>
<p>We use as the reference point, in order to scale the ratio values between zero and one, the highest ratio across all countries in a ten year timeframe. The lowest score is fixed as the lower end point.</p>

<h2>Livelihoods &amp; Economies: Livelihoods</h2>
<p><br></p>
<p><br> Goal Description</p>
<p>The Livelihoods sub-goal describes livelihood quantity and quality for people living on the coast. Livelihoods includes the number of jobs in different marine related sectors. Ideally, this sub-goal would speak to the quality and quantity of marine jobs in an area. It would encompass all the marine sectors that supply jobs and wages to coastal communities, incorporating information on the sustainability of different sectors while also telling about the working conditions and job satisfaction.</p>
<p>Due to an earlier lack of sector-specific employment information, the BHI currently uses overall employment rates in the Baltic coastal regions to represent ocean-dependent livelihood. The assumption being that relative employment rates in marine sectors mirror those in the regions' economies overall. Subsequent iterations of the BHI will use Blue Growth Report employment data, to more accurately represent the societal value derived from marine livelihoods in the Baltic Sea.</p>
<p><br> Model &amp; Data</p>
<p>We downloaded <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;plugin=0&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=t2020_10&amp;tableSelection=1">Eurostat country-level employment rate and target employment rate</a> from most recent years and select a subset of years based on years included in ECO status, which is based on the Blue Growth reports. (This data is not available for Russia. <a href="http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=naida_10_pe&amp;lang=en">Another dataset is downloaded with information for Russia.</a>)</p>
<p>Regional employment numbers are derived using NUTS2 eployment rates and population density information: NUTS2 employment percentages are multiplied by the population in the 25km inland buffer associated with a BHI region. These employment numbers are summed across all areas (NUTS2 regions intersected with BHI regions) associated with a BHI region to get the total employed people in the BHI region. Regional employment rate = number of people employed/regional population. For country data, we have employment rate data directly.</p>
<p><br> Reference points</p>
<p>Reference point is max Region:Country employment ratio of the past five years, and highest country employment in the last fifteen years (77.4%). The region-to-country ratio puts the value into local context, then adjusting with respect to highest country employment rate in the last fifteen years from around the Baltic Sea situates the ratio in broader geographic context.</p>

<h2>Livelihoods &amp; Economies: Economies</h2>
<p><br></p>
<p><br> Goal Description</p>
<p>The Economies goal captures the economic value associated with marine industries, using revenue from marine sectors. Currently, it is composed of a single component: revenue (Gross Value Added). Gross value added (GVA) is defined as the value of output less the value of intermediate consumption. It is used to measure the output or contribution of a particular sector.</p>
<p>Ideally, the economic sub-goal would also incorporate information on the sustainability of the different marine sectors.</p>
<p><br> Model &amp; Data</p>
<p><br> Data</p>
<p>Data for each country were downloaded from <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/maritimeaffairs/sites/maritimeaffairs/files/2020_06_blueeconomy-2020-ld_final.pdf">The EU Blue Economy Report. 2020.</a>, which provided 2009 and 2018 marine sector-specific revenue data (GVA) among other metrics, in the country-specific Appendices. The report also identified the potential for Blue Growth in each of the EU Member States (MS) of the Baltic Sea Region (BSR) as well as at sea-basin level.</p>
<p>(Due to a lack of data, Russian regions (19, 22, 33) have NA scores for this subgoal.)</p>
<p><br> Status Model</p>
<p>Because the Blue Economy Report 2020 contains GVA values only for 2009 and 2018, the actual annual growth rates are not known and instead a constant annual growth rate (AGR) across the 9 years is estimated using the formula:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[AGR = \Bigg(\frac{FinalValue}{BeginningValue}\Bigg)^{\Big(1/numYears\Big)} - 1\]</span></p>
<p>Thus, all years between 2009 and 2018 will have the same status and trend values within a given country.</p>
<p>The goal model compares the estimated annual growth rate per sector to the target (1.5% between 2010 and 2020, as envisioned in the Report), calculating status first per sector. The overall status is then calculated as the average of the sector-statuses, weighted by relative contribution of the sectors to the country's total marine-related economic revenue.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Status = \sum_{Sectors}{\big((SectorRevenue/TotalRevenue) \cdot SectorStatus}\big)\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[SectorStatus = \begin{cases} 
      0 &amp;  \hspace{10pt} SectorAGR \leq -1.5 \\
      100/3 \hspace{2pt}\cdot \hspace{2pt} SectorAGR \hspace{3pt} + \hspace{3pt} 50 &amp; \hspace{10pt}-1.5\leq SectorAGR \leq 1.5 \\
      100 &amp; \hspace{10pt} 1.5\leq SectorAGR
   \end{cases}
\]</span></p>
<p><br> Trend Model</p>
<p>Trend of this goal is the weighted average of the growth rates of each sector by their relative contribution to the total revenue, where the sector growth rates are the annual growth rates (AGR) estimated from 2009 and 2018 GVA data.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Trend = \sum_{Sectors}{\big((SectorRevenue/TotalRevenue) \cdot SectorAGR}\big)\]</span></p>
<p><br> Reference points</p>
<p>As reference points we used a 1.5% annual growth between 2010 and 2020, as envisioned in the Blue Growth Report.</p>

<h2>Sense of Place: Iconic Species</h2>
<p><br></p>
<p><br> Goal Description</p>
<p>Marine species hold multiple meanings for humans, ranging from the food provisioning and socio-economic services perspective to aesthetic and religious values across diverse societies and communities. This subgoal captures the status of species that are important to a region because they are relevant to local cultural identity.</p>
<p><strong>For the BHI, a survey identified the following iconic species:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cod<br />
</li>
<li>Flounder<br />
</li>
<li>Herring<br />
</li>
<li>Perch<br />
</li>
<li>Pike<br />
</li>
<li>Salmon<br />
</li>
<li>Trout<br />
</li>
<li>Sprat<br />
</li>
<li>Grey seal</li>
<li>European otter</li>
<li>Harbour seal<br />
</li>
<li>Harbour porpoise<br />
</li>
<li>Ringed seal</li>
<li>White-tailed sea eagle</li>
<li>Common eider/</li>
</ul>
<p><br> Model &amp; Data</p>
<p>The status of iconic species was evaluated using species observational data from the HELCOM database. A subset of species identified as culturally significant in the region included eight fish (cod, flounder, herring, perch, pike, salmon, trout, and sprat), five mammals (grey seal, harbour seal, ringed seal, harbour porpoise, and European otter), and two birds (sea eagle and common eider). The status of each of these iconic species is a numeric weight corresponding to their Red List threat category (ranging from “extinct” to “least concern”) of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).</p>
<p>HELCOM provides species checklists for the Baltic that include distribution and a complete list of all species assessed with IUCN criteria. Species were assigned a <em>threat category</em> (ranging from &quot;extinct&quot; to &quot;least concern&quot;) and assigned a weight. The goal score is the average weight of all species assessed.</p>
<p><br> Reference points</p>
<p>A maximum score of 100 will be achieved in the case when all species are categorised as <strong>’Least Concern’</strong>.</p>

<h2>Clean Waters: Eutrophication</h2>
<p><br></p>
<p><br> Goal Description</p>
<p>The Eutrophication sub-goal of the Clean Water goal captures the degree to which local waters are affected by eutrophication. For the BHI, five indicators were included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Winter (December-February) dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) concentrations in the surface layer (0 - 10 m depth)</li>
<li>Winter (December-February) dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) concentrations in the surface layer (0 - 10 m depth)</li>
<li>Summer (June-September) chlorophyll a concentration in the surface layer (0 - 10 m depth)<br />
</li>
<li>Summer (June-September) Secchi depth<br />
</li>
<li>Oxygen debt indicator</li>
</ul>
<p>These five indicators are HELCOM core indicators (Baltic Sea Environmental Proceedings No 143). Oxygen debt is calculated using the ICES HEAT assessment tool, <a href="https://github.com/OHI-Baltic/HEAT">in a separate repository</a>.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><br> Model &amp; Data</p>
<p>The geometric means of the status of all five indicators have been calculated for Bornholm Basin, Western Gotland Basin, Eastern Gotland Basin, Northern Baltic Proper and Gulf of Finland. For the other basins only four indicators (without oxygen debt) have been used to calculate the eutrophication status. Moreover, <strong>only offshore data were used for all the core indicators</strong>, due to insufficient data and/or a threshold value associated to coastal areas.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mean Summer Secchi depth (June-September) data from ICES and SMHI databases.</li>
<li>Winter (DIN), (DIP), and summer chlorophyll a data were downloaded from the Baltic Nest Institute database (DAS and NEST); additional chlorophyll a data come from ICES and SMHI.</li>
<li>Oxygen debt calculations are based on oxygen data from ICES (CTD and bottle data), and follow the approach introduced in HELCOM Indicator Sheets (2018) where the oxygen debt below halocline is assessed and general additive models are applied to address temporal, seasonal and spatial variation within the basins (more information available at the HELCOM 2013 (BSEP133)).</li>
</ul>
<p><br> Method Overview</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Regarding the status calculation, we calculate a five-year moving average for each year in the dataset only for three core indicators (Secchi depth, DIN and DIP) and an annual average for the other two core indicators (Chlorophyll a and Oxygen debt) due to gaps in the data.</p></li>
<li><p>Status is calculated on the basin level and then applied to all regions, for each year between 2000 and 2019. Status for the each indicator is calculated as basin mean divided by basin target.</p></li>
<li><p>Regarding the trend calculation, as all core indicators are slow response variables, we use a 10-year period to calculate the trend with a minimum of 5 data points. The trend value is the slope of the linear regression (mean value vs year) multiplied by the year of future interest (5 years from status year) and this value is constrained to between -1 and 1.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><br/></p>
<p><br> Reference points</p>
<p>The reference points for the eutrophication subgoal are set following the thresholds set by HELCOM (2018) and agreed on by the HELCOM Heads of Delegation (HOD): <a href="https://helcom.fi/media/documents/Eutorophication-targets_BSEP133.pdf">Approaches and methods for eutrophication target setting in the Baltic Sea region</a></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><br> Secchi depth Indicator</p>
<p><em>Secchi depth</em> reference points are set according to the HELCOM thresholds (HELCOM 2018). They are based on results obtained in the TARGREV project (HELCOM 2013a), taking advantage of the work carried out during the EUTRO PRO project (HELCOM 2009) and national work for WFD. The final targets were set through an expert evaluation process done by the intersessional activity on development of core eutrophication indicators (HELCOM CORE EUTRO) and the targets were adopted by the HELCOM Heads of Delegations.

<p><br> Dissolved Inorganic Nitrogen and Phosphorus, and Chlorophyll a</p>
<p>HELCOM sub-basin specific reference points for the <em>winter (DIN), (DIP), and summer chlorophyll</em> a are set according to the HELCOM thresholds (HELCOM 2018).</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><br> Oxygen Debt Indicator</p>
<p>The <em>oxygen debt</em>, i.e., &quot;missing&quot; oxygen in relation to fully oxygenated water column, calculations follow the approach introduced in HELCOM Indicator Sheets (2018) and the same threshold values (the 95th percentiles before 1940, detected using change point analysis) are used. There are only two distinct reference points, set for the Baltic Proper (including Gdansk Basin, Eastern and Western Gotland Basins, Northern Baltic Proper, and Gulf of Finland) and for Bornholm Basin. These targets were also set according to HELCOM, as described in <a href="https://www.helcom.fi/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/BSEP143.pdf9">Baltic Sea Environmental Proceedings No 143</a>.</p>

<h2>Clean Waters: Trash</h2>
<p><br></p>
<p><br> Goal Description</p>
<p>The Trash sub-goal assesses a region's ability to manage litter in order to prevent it from entering the ocean and causing harm to the coastal and marine environments. Marine litter is a large global concern, impacting all marine environments of the world and, therefore, needs to be monitored.</p>
<p><br> Model &amp; Data</p>
<p>Currently (2020), the <a href="https://helcom.fi/helcom-at-work/groups/pressure/en-marine-litter/">HELCOM Expert Network on Marine Litter</a> is working on facilitating the implementation of the Regional Action Plan on Marine Litter, and developing <a href="http://stateofthebalticsea.helcom.fi/pressures-and-their-status/marine-litter/">core indicators</a> to be used for the second HELCOM holistic assessment of the ecosystem health.</p>
<p>Marine litter can be found on beaches and shorelines, floating on the surface, submerged in the water column or sunk to the bottom. Therefore, different main indicators might be used: - beach litter monitoring - floating litter monitoring - seafloor litter monitoring</p>
<p>However, the majority of litter monitoring methods are not standardized specifically for the Baltic Sea. There is a need to harmonize data collection, give more information for reference, improve comparability of results and allow benchmarking. These proposed new actions will be discussed during 2020 by the relevant HELCOM Working Groups and probably inserted in the updated BSAP.</p>
<p>The status is calculated by a country's amount of mismanaged plastic litter that has the potential to enter the ocean:</p>
<p><a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/347/6223/768.full.pdf+html">Modelled data by <em>Jambeck et al. 2015</em>: Plastic waste inputs from land into the ocean</a>.</p>
<p>The modelled data have been downweighted for Russia, Germany, Denmark and Sweden (proportion of coastal pop/national pop) to include only the litter that reaches the the Baltic Sea from these countries.</p>
<p><br> Reference points</p>
<p>The good environmental status from the Marine Strategy Framework Directive is qualitatively framed as the situation where 'properties and quantities of marine litter do not cause harm to the coastal and marine environment'. Currently, there is no official quantitative reference point set. Therefore, for this assessment the upper reference point was set as the maximum amount of litter among all Baltic surrounding countries in 2010, and the lower reference point is zero litter in the Baltic Sea.</p>
<p><strong>Beach litter threshold proposal (for next BHI iteration)</strong> The JRC presented a <a href="https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/326ae5ac-0419-4167-83ca-e3c210534a69/library/254a8e7b-443f-4889-912a-941889b29cf3/details">beach litter threshold proposal</a> for an EU-level beach litter threshold value for MSFD criterion D10C1. The threshold value proposed of a total abundance of 13 items/100m is based on the value achieved by the top 10 percent EU beaches in the baseline data set in 2015-2016.</p>
<!-- <br> Considerations for BHI 3.0 {-} -->
<!-- **Standardization:** The majority of litter monitoring methods are not standardized specifically for the Baltic Sea. Data collection needs to be harmonized, to improve comparability of results and thus allow benchmarking. -->
<!-- **Microplastics:** Including data on microplastics would result in a more complete picture, but these data are not currently available. -->
<!-- **Work-in-progress:** In HELCOM, assessment approaches based on core indicators are currently underway for beach litter, litter on the seafloor and microlitter. Threshold values for the assessment are being developed in an EU-process which can be used in the next BHI iteration. -->

<h2>Clean Waters: Contaminants</h2>
<p><br></p>
<p><br> Goal Description</p>
<p>The Contaminant sub-goal of the Clean Water goal captures the degree to which local waters are unpolluted by contaminants. This sub-goal scores highest when the contamination level is below a threshold, which is defined by the Marine Framework Directive. For the BHI three contaminants indicators are proposed, describing different aspects of toxicity: dioxin and dioxin like compounds, polychlorinated biphenyl compounds (PCBs), and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS). In addition, a penalty factor has been applied to account for the fact that current monitoring programs do not cover all the registered and harmful contaminants.</p>

<p><br> PFOS Indicator</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.helcom.fi/Core%20Indicators/PFOS_HELCOM%20core%20indicator%202016_web%20version.pdf">HELCOM PFOS core indicator document, p.3</a>, the &quot;GES boundary is set to 9.1 μg/kg wet weight (or 9.1 ng/g ww) with the protection goal of human health&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The GES boundary is an environmental quality standard (EQS), derived at EU level as a substance included on the list of priority substances under the Water Framework Directive (European Commission 2000, 2013). GES, in accordance with the MSFD is defined as 'concentrations of contaminants at levels not giving rise to pollution effects'. EQS are derived from ecotoxicological studies to protect freshwater and marine ecosystems from potential adverse effects of chemicals, as well as adverse effects on human health via drinking water and food from aquatic environments. Quality Standards (QS) are derived for different protection goals, i.e.: pelagic and benthic communities, top-predators in these ecosystems, and human health. The most stringent of these QS is the basis for the EQS. The EQS boundary for PFOS is based on the QS set for biota to protect human health (9.1 μg/ kg fish ww), defined for edible parts in fish. For harmonization purposes the EC Guidance Document No. 32 on biota monitoring (the implementation of EQS biota) under the WFD was developed (European Commission 2014). This guidance document recommends that the results from the monitoring should be standardized to represent fish at a trophic level of 4, which is an estimate of the general trophic level in commercial fish in Europe. The recommendation to obtain PFOS data in fish at a trophic level of 4 is to adjust the values from monitoring in accordance with trophic magnification factors and trophic level.&quot; <span class="math inline">\(-\)</span> <a href="http://www.helcom.fi/Core%20Indicators/PFOS_HELCOM%20core%20indicator%202016_web%20version.pdf">HELCOM PFOS core indicator document, p.8</a></p>

<p><br> TEQ values for PCBs in Sediment</p>
<p>Only a few environmental quality standards (EQS) are to date defined in the Baltic Sea for marine surface sediments. The Norwegian threshold values are often used when a comparison with ecotoxicological effects is needed. In particular, the <a href="https://www.miljodirektoratet.no/globalassets/publikasjoner/m1132/m1132.pdf">Norwegian Environment Agency</a> has defined EQS in sediment for 28 EU priority substances.</p>
<p>PCB7 (sum PCB 28, 52, 101, 118, 138, 153, and 180): Target is set at 4.1 TS ug/kg dw. <a href="http://www.vannportalen.no/globalassets/nasjonalt/dokumenter/veiledere-direktoratsgruppa/Klassifisering-av-miljotilstand-i-vann-02-2018.pdf">Environmental quality classification of water bodies</a></p>
<p><strong>Recommended threshold values are given only for total PCB7, and not for each individual congener. This is because toxicity data are available for only a minority of congeners.</strong></p>

<p><br> TEQ values for Dioxins in Sediments</p>
<p>Dioxin and dioxin-like compounds. Target is set at 0.00086 TEQ ug/kg dw (Total TEQ). <a href="https://www.miljodirektoratet.no/globalassets/publikasjoner/m1132/m1132.pdf">Norwegian Environment Agency</a> TEQ values from the <a href="http://www.who.int/ipcs/assessment/tef_values.pdf">World Health Organization 2005</a></p>

<h2>Biodiversity</h2>
<p><br></p>
<p><br> Goal Description</p>
<p>This goal captures the biodiversity status of the Baltic Sea ecosystems and intactness of broad, encompassing marine habitats/zones.</p>
<p><br> Model &amp; Data</p>
<p>This goal consists of five components: - benthic habitats - pelagic habitats - fish - mammals (seals) - seabirds</p>
<p>It has been evaluated using the biological quality ratios and seabird abundance, derived in the integrated biodiversity assessments from HELCOM (the HELCOM assessment tool: <a href="https://github.com/NIVA-Denmark/BalticBOOST" class="uri">https://github.com/NIVA-Denmark/BalticBOOST</a>). These are based on core indicators for key species and species groups, including abundance, distribution, productivity, physiological and demographic characteristics.</p>
<p>Statuses of these five biodiversity components are aggregated first within each component, combining coastal area values with area-weighted averages, then combining the values for coastal and offshore areas of each BHI region with equal weight. A single biodiversity status score per region is calculated as geometric mean of the five components. More detailed information on the indicators and the biodiversity assessment can be found at HELCOM (<a href="http://stateofthebalticsea.helcom.fi/biodiversity-and-its-status/" class="uri">http://stateofthebalticsea.helcom.fi/biodiversity-and-its-status/</a>).</p>
<p><br> Reference points</p>
<p>For the seabirds, the HELCOM core indicator threshold of 0.75 abundance, decided by HELCOM, was used as good status (corresponding to a status score of 100 in BHI). For the other four components (benthic habitats, pelagic habitats, fish, and mammals), a biological quality ratio (BQR) of 0.6 was developed by HELCOM with the aim to represent good status and was used as here as the target.</p>
