The Baltic Health Index is a project jointly led by [Stockholm Resilience Centre (SRC)](https://www.stockholmresilience.org/), at Stockholm University, Sweden together with the [Ocean Health Index team](http://ohi-science.org/about/). The first phase has been funded by the Johansson Family foundation and the Baltic Ecosystem Adaptive Management, [BEAM](https://www.su.se/ostersjocentrum/english/beam), a five-year research programme (2010-2014). The second phase, started Jan 2019, is funded by the Johansson Family foundation. 

This trans-disciplinary project is led by [Thorsten Blenckner](https://www.stockholmresilience.org/contact-us/staff/2008-06-16-blenckner.html) at SRC and involves many international researchers from around the Baltic Sea and management organisations.

The Baltic Health Index formally started in 2015 and preliminary scores were completed in 2017. Members of the team conducting the first assessment additionally included Jennifer Griffiths, Ning Jiang, Julie Lowndes, Melanie Frazer, Cornelia Ludwig.  Currently, the second assessment is conducted by Eleanore Campbell, Susa Niiranen and Thorsten Blenckner.
