HARVESTING WILD-CAUGHT SEAFOOD SUSTAINABLY
</h4>

<h5 style="font-size:23px">
This sub-goal describes the ability to maximize the sustainable yield of wild-caught seafood for human consumption.
</h5>

<h5>
Many seafoods have been a minor part of the diet in many Baltic Sea countries so far and current consumption is limited to a few fish species that are predominantly imported.

<h4 style="color:#051729;line-height:50px;font-weight:600;">
WHAT DOES THIS SCORE MEAN?
</h4>

Data used for this subgoal are based on the two most important commercial important fish species that are used as a food source: cod and herring.

A high score indicates that the highest theoretical equilibrium yield being continuously taken on average from a stock is under existing average environmental conditions without significantly affecting the reproduction process.

Developing an approach that better reflects economic aspects of food provisioning by the Baltic fisheries is ideal.
