ENSURING ACCESS TO ARTISANAL FISHING FOR LOCAL COMMUNITIES

This goal assesses whether people who need to fish on a small, local scale have the opportunity to do so.

Around 10 % of the population in the Baltic catchment area – around 10 million – fish for recreation.

WHAT DOES THIS SCORE MEAN?
</h4>

The focus of the goal is on coastal fish stock as a proxy for the entire goal. Target values are set based on site-specific time-series data, as coastal fish generally have local population structures, limited migration, and show local responses to environmental change.

A high score indicates that the coastal fish stock for artisanal fishing has the appropriate abundance, with high abundance for coastal key species (perch, cod and flounder) and not too high abundance for cyprinids. 

In some basins there is lack of data and in others very few monitoring stations, and scaling up from monitoring station to subbasin does likely not provide a fully representative assessment. Also, including ‘need’ and ‘access’ alongside the condition of coastal fisheries will give a more complete overview of artisanal fishing opportunity.
